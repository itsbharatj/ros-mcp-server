## ðŸ”€ How to Pull-request

1. **Fork the repository:** Click the "Fork" button in the top right corner of the GitHub page.

2. **Create a new branch:**  Create a separate branch for your changes to keep them isolated from the main project.

   ```bash
   git checkout -b "your_branch_name"
   ```

3. **Make your changes:** Edit files with your additions or corrections.  Please follow the existing format and style.  When adding a new function, make sure to include:

    * The function name and format.
    * A brief description of the function's functionality.
    * Any parameters the function takes.
    * The return type of the function.

4. **Commit your changes:** Commit your changes with a clear and concise message explaining what you've done.

   git commit -m "your_commit_message"
   ```

5. **Push your branch:** Push your branch to your forked repository.

   ```bash
   git push origin "your_branch_name"
   ```

6. **Create a pull request:** Navigate to the original repository and click the "New pull request" button. Select your fork and the branch you pushed. **Important:** Target the `develop` branch (not `main`) for your pull request. Provide a clear title and description of your changes.

7. **Review and merge:** Your pull request will be reviewed by the maintainers. They may suggest changes or ask for clarification. Once approved, your changes will be merged into the main repository.

## Style & CI
We use **Ruff** for both linting and formatting. CI requires:
- `ruff format --check .`
- `ruff check .`

**Local setup**
- Option A (recommended): `pre-commit install` (auto-fixes on commit)
- Option B (manual): `ruff format . && ruff check --fix .`

**Using Black locally?**
- That's fine. Please align with:
  - `line-length = 100`, target `py310`
  - Avoid `--preview`, `--skip-string-normalization`, `--skip-magic-trailing-comma`
- CI uses Ruff as the final arbiter; run `ruff format .` before pushing.

# Governance

1. **Neutral Standards**  
   The technology specifications of ROS-MCP-Server will be openly discussed and decided through a Technical Steering Committee (TSC) that includes representatives from participating industrial and research partners.

2. **Open Development**  
   All core code, demos, and tutorials will be developed in public repositories under a permissive open-source license (Apache 2.0). Discussions and proposals will be tracked transparently.

3. **Fair Contribution Model**  
   Contributions will be accepted based on technical merit through the standard GitHub pull-request process, reviewed by maintainers.

4. **Safety & Responsibility**  
   Given the power of AI-robotics, we commit to developing safety guidelines and best practices, reviewed by both technical and ethics advisors.

5. **Commercial vs. Community Boundary**  
   ROS-MCP-Server core will always remain free and open. Contoro may offer commercial services (enterprise feature support, certified distributions, integrations, and others) on top, but the open standard will not be locked behind proprietary barriers.
